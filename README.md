Scripts of the project for Scientific Computing on the p-Laplace equation

UnitSphere1A : it contains the scripts to solve the problem 1a of the report, i.e. the p-Laplace equation with homogeneus Dirichlet boundary conditions over the unitary sphere.

SphereTorus1B : it contains the scripts to solve the problem 1b of the report, i.e. the p-Laplace equation with homogeneus Dirichlet boundary conditions over the unitary sphere without the torus.

SphereSphere2A : it contains the scripts to solve the problem 2a of the report, i.e. it finds the p-Harmonics over the numerical domain B_4(0)\B_1(0)

SphereTorus2B : it contains the scripts to solve the problem 2b of the report, i.e. it finds the p-Harmonics over the numerical domain B_4(0)\T^2
